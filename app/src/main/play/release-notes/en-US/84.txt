# 0.1.0 - Candidates Window for Physical Keyboard

## Highlights

- The input method will show a floating candidates window and hide virtual keyboard when you start typing with a physical keyboard
- Adopt fcitx5 "candidate action" API, to pin candidates in Pinyin/Shuangpin and forget words in RIME
- The application now targets Android API 35, and handles navigation bar or system gesture insets more reliably
- The application has been renamed to "小企鹅输入法" in Chinese, and "Fcitx5" for non-Chinese languages

### New plugins

- Thai, this is finally possible since scancode is sent to fcitx along with the keysym

### Notable changes

- Removed some bundled table input methods that nobody would use: 晚风、冰蝉全息、仓颉（简体中文）
Some actually useful ones can be found in our F-Droid repo: https://f5a.torus.icu/fdroid/repo/ , or updater: https://github.com/fcitx5-android/fcitx5-android-updater
- "Advanced - Ignore system cursor position" has been disabled by default, it should be stable enough
- "Theme - Navigation bar background" now defaults to "Keyboard background image" on Oreo+ devices

### Build process improvements

- Removed many unnecessary files in APK, eg. baseline.prof, vcsInfo, dependenciesInfo, kotlin-tooling-metadata.json ...
- Make use of AGP's splits.abi and signingConfig feature, and make prefab related tasks run more reliably
